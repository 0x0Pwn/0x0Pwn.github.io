So letâ€™s focus on port 8080 (Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1)â€¦

## Enumeration

As I always do with all machines I set out to do the directory scan with **gobuster** and **wfuzz,** and I find some things:

## Exploiting

The truth is that I spent quite a long time seeing if I could get something out of this and the website, but the solution was much easier than I thought.

After being a while with this, in a perhaps a little desperate way, I searched the whole name of the port 8080 version in google and I found a gem.

The website â†’ https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Metasploitable/Apache/Tomcat_and_Coyote

Then we just had to follow the steps, first we found out the directories of the web page, then the password of the `/manager/` and finally we uploaded the reverse shell and we entered as **root**, and all thanks to msfconsole.

Here are some of the screenshots I took during the process, but the web page I have left explains everything in much more detail:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login
```

```bash
use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload
```

Here is a video of the final part of how I accessed the machine as **root**.
