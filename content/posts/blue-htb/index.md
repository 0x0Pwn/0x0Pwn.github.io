## Room Information

- Room name: Blue
- Difficulty level: Easy
- Room link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Blue

![Untitled](/HTB/Blue.png)

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- Msfvenom

## Port Scanning

First we need to do a port scan to know what are we trying to exploit.

![Untitled](/HTB/nmap-blue.png)

Look like we have two smb ports the 139,445 so we are going to focus on them ...

## Enumeration

With `nmap 10.10.10.40 -p 139,445 --script smb-vuln*` I am going to see if nmap can see some vulnerabilities.

I found a possible vulnerability the MS17-010 so let's pwn the machine

## Exploiting

The CVE-2017-0143 or better called Eternal Blue is a vulnerability that allows us to exploit the Microsoftâ€™s implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol with a crafted package to have RCE in the victim machine.

And we are now in :))

## Gaining an Initial Foothold

We have root permissions so the machine is finished...

## Lessons Learned

- What insights did you gain from the room?
    
    Now, we know how to perform a windows samba attack with the eternal blue vulnerability that allows me to RCE the victim machine.
    
- Were there any novel tools or techniques employed?
    
    I performed a CVE-2017-0143 exploit and msfvenom reverse shell.
