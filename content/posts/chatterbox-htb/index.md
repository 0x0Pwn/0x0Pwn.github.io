## Room Information

- Room name: Chatterbox
- Difficulty level: Medium
- Room link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Chatterbox

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- crackmapexec
- msfvenom
- icacls
- smbserver
- smbclient
- searchsploit

## Port Scanning

Other room, other port scan.

```bash
nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -n -Pn -oG allPorts 10.10.10.74
```

![Untitled](/HTB/1-chatterbox.png)

```bash
nmap -p 135,139,445,9255,9256,49152,49153,49154,49155,49156,49157 --min-rate 5000 -sCV -Pn -oN targeted 10.10.10.74
```

```bash
nmap -p 9255,9256 -sCV -n --min-rate 5000 -Pn -oN firewall 10.10.10.74
```

This was so suspicious, so after trying a lot of things with **smb** ports I looked at the **AChat** service.

## Enumeration

On this machine there was no web page so the only data enumeration I could do was from the smb ports, but I got nothing because even though I was allowed to connect with an anonymous user, I had no permissions to list anything.

## Exploiting

After seeing that there were some ports that supported the service called AChat, what I did was very simple, I searched in searchsploit AChat and I found an exploit that through the buffer overflow that allowed to execute commands remotely, so I modified a couple of things and I did that instead I generated a reverse shell.

Then this is the command that generated the payload just below, so I modified it so that instead of running the windows calculator, it would generate a reverse shell. 

```bash

With this, the only thing left to do was to change the old payload for this one, listen on port 4444 and execute the code.

At this point I was in ðŸ˜‡

## Escalating Privileges

As soon as I enterd the machine I went to the main user's folder alfred, and I could see the flag without any problems. Then, I went to the Administrator user and I saw that I could enter without problems and I could also enter the desktop where the root flag was, but I could not see it because I did not have permissions. I found it so strange that I looked for how I could see the permissions I had in windows and I saw that using icacls I could see them. I quickly realized that I had F permissions on the desktop folder so I could easily see what was in the root flag with a simple command and using the above application.

```bash
icacls root.txt /grant alfred:F
```

Also I search exploits before discovering the other formâ€¦

## Lessons Learned

- What insights did you gain from the room?
    
    I learn more about AChat.
    
- Where there any novel tools or techniques employed?
    
    The use of icacls.
