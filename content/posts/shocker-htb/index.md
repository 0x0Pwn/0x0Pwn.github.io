## Room Information

- Room name: Shocker
- Difficulty level: Easy
- Room link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Shocker

![Untitled](/HTB/shocker-icon.png)

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- Wfuzz
- Burpsuite

## Port Scanning

We can find two service up and running one web server in the port 80 and a ssh in port 2222

## Enumeration

If we visit the page we find a basic page with a basic html with only a picture.

When I tried to fuzz the directories of the website, I found that gobuster doesn‚Äôt found anything and after several
tests i realized that the website only recognize directories adding ‚Äú/‚Äù at the end of the URL. So after that I
used wfuzz with this commands: `wfuzz -c --hc=404 -t 200  -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt http://10.10.10.56/FUZZ/`.

And then when I realized that a folder called cgi-bin exists, I do this: `wfuzz -c --hc=404 -t 200 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -z list,sh-pl-cgi http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/FUZZ.FUZ2Z`
To find out which scripts are contained in the folder.

Thanks to the error message of the website, it is observed that when no slash is added, a "not found" page is returned. In this example, the "cgi-bin" directory is tested. "cgi-bin" is specifically tested because the name of the machine gives a clue that it is likely vulnerable to the Shellshock Bash remote code execution vulnerability, which affects web servers utilizing CGI (Common Gateway Interface).
Once I saw that the victim machine contained this folder, the vulnerability called ShellShock, which consists of remotely executing commands using the User-Agent, immediately came to my mind.

With this directory scan I found that cgi-bin folder exists

And with this, finally I found that an archive called user.txt exists inside the folder.

Having seen all this, I now focused on the shellshock vulnerability, which consisted in modifying the header of the get http request to be able to execute commands remotely. I personally used the program curl in terminal, but it can also be done from BurpSuite. It should be noted that before executing the request I listened with `nc -nlvp 443`.

Finally, the machine is pawned !!!

## TTY Treatment

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
ctrl + z
stty raw -echo; fg
restet xterm
export TERM=xterm
```
## Gaining an Initial Foothold

Once in the home of the pwned user shelly we can see a user.txt which has the flag

## Privilege Escalation

Now we are in, let‚Äôs elevate privilege

![Untitled](/HTB/shocker-13.png)

We can see with the sudo -l that we can use perl with root privilegies without any password, let‚Äôs take this advantage to pawn the system.

If we check in [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl/#sudo) we can use `sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'` to escalate privilege.

## Lessons Learned

- What did you learn from the room?
    
    Now we have learned how to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability to gain remote code execution and how to use sudo permissions to escalate privileges.
    
- Were there any new tools or techniques used?
    
    The use of the flag -f in gobuster for directory fuzzing.
