## Room Information

- Room name: Sense
- Difficulty level: Easy
- Room link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Sense

![Untitled](/HTB/Sense.png)

## Tools Used

- nmap
- wfuzz
- whatweb
- exploit.py


## Port Scanning

![Untitled](/HTB/nmap-sense.png)

In the port scan we can see that there are only two open ports, 443(https) and 80(http)...

## Enumeration

As always first thing i'm going to do is:

```bash
whatweb 10.10.10.60
```
But this time it throws me nothing relevant.

Then I did a dns and url scan with **wfuzz**. On first time it throws me nothing relevant and I went 
to take a look and try combinations on the website (also I tried with **hydra**), which by the way was a page of a login.

After a long time trying combinations with hydra and seeing different exploits and vulnerabilities with searchsploit and
others, I began to think that I missed something and decided to do a web analysis again to discover directories in .txt .php .sh etc. 
Since in the first scan I did I got a .txt file that contained some information about vulnerabilities ...

And let's go we have user and passwd :)

So I logged and in the menu page said's that the version of pfSense was 2.1.3, so I search it on searchsploit and there was only a exploit,
I tried them but no works, so I searched the CVE on google and I found one that works :)

the exploit code:

## Escalation of privileges

There's no escalation on this machine due to I'm root at the first time.

## Leason Learned

- What insights did you gain from the room?
    
    I acquired knowledge on the research of sploits.
    
- Were there any novel tools or techniques employed?
    
    No.

**Thank you for reading, and happy hacking! ðŸ˜„**
